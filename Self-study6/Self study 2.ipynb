Experiment with different NN architectures (also varying the convolutional parameters: size, stride, padding, etc) and observe the effect wrt. the loss/accuracy on the training and validation dataset (training, validation). Note that when adding new layers (including dropout [Lecture 2, Slide 13], pooling, etc.) you need to make sure that the dimensionality of the layers match up. **IMPORTANT:** ignore the test set at this stage (i.e., comment out the relevant lines above) so that the results for the test set do not influence your model choice.\n",
    "3. In the model above we use a simple gradient descent learning scheme. Try other types of optimizers (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) and analyze the effect.\n",
    "4. Lastly, save your best model and results. At the next lecture we will then see who got the best results :-) Note that for this to be meaningful it is important that you have not relied on the test set while doing model learning/selection.\n",
    "5. If you feel adventurous, try investigating some of the other datasets that come prepacakged with PyTorch (see https://pytorch.org/vision/0.8/datasets.html). For instnce, for FashionMNIST you only need to change the dataloader from datasets.MNIST to datasets.FashionMNIST."
